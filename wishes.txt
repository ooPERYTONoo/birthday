Happy Birthday to the Queen of Laziness!

ðŸŽ‰ Honestly, I donâ€™t know how you manage to be this talented and this lazy at the same timeâ€”itâ€™s truly an art form.
If being lazy was a competition, you'd win goldâ€¦ but only if someone else picked it up for you! ðŸ˜‚ Jokes aside,

I donâ€™t say this oftenâ€”mostly because Iâ€™m too busy annoying youâ€”but you genuinely mean the world to me.

Youâ€™re like my built-in best friend, therapist, partner-in-crime, and occasional enemy... all in one beautifully chaotic package.

Our bond is unbreakableâ€”mostly because you know too many of my secrets.

But seriously, life would be so boring without your constant drama, weird jokes, and surprisingly good advice.

Youâ€™re the reason Iâ€™ve survived so many things, and also the reason Iâ€™ve nearly lost my mind a few times!

Thank you for being the amazing, hilarious, and slightly crazy sister that you are.

I wouldn't trade you for anything... except maybe unlimited pizza. Just kidding (kind of).

Have the laziest, happiest, most snack-filled birthday ever!
